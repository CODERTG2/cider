Description: So basically it brings fun back to transaction tracking. I looked for a long time for a good manual simple transaction tracker to help teenagers like me track their finances and I couldn't find a good one so I made this one! Clean, consistent UI!

How did you build this: I used Swift UI to build the app. This was my first super independent one and honestly I was super new so I stored the code backups in Google Docs lol, but I worked for a bunch of months on it and made it super polished, I got some feedback on it from a local bank executive that I talked with and he gave me some code feedback!

Did you use Hakatime to log your progress?: Yes, Needs Context. I had been initally using Hackatime for this project but after some issues with my MBA's storage, I had to contact AppleCare Support who when they were doing some stuff with XCode, they deleted something or whatever with the Wakatime XCode CLI and so for some reason Wakatime just completely said Nope, your app's progress doesn't exist anymore, so I had to re-set it up but now it only has like 20m of time. If you go back to my git ffor the project you can see I've been working on this for like 8 months so I have tons of people who could vouch for me I probably have 60 or more hrs into it. Feel free to message me to talk about this, I understand the requirements I just wanted to explain my situation!
