**Name**: Lumen

**Description**: Lumen is an AI-powered notes taker. In Biology, I loved drawing excessively-detailed diagrams of each part of the body as the teacher explained their functions, and I often failed to write down the actual functions. This led to my "notes" being diagrams that I could easily find online, while I lacked the information my teacher told us. To solve this, I created Lumen, an AI-powered notes taker with no restrictions. It works for all subjects, and allows you to either record the lecture(if you're permitted to bring a phone/ipad/macbook to class) or upload your teacher's notes after class.

**How did you build this**: I used SwiftUI to build the app.

**Did you use Hakatime to log your progress?**: **Yes** / No
(I worked about 50 hours total on the app. Only 6 hours were successfully added to the right project by the wakatime mac app. The <<LAST_PROJECT>> project is really a combination of my Xcode projects - which is 92 hrs total, and about 30 hours of that were for my previous project Lexicon, and 10 for my next cider submission. Based on this, i'd estimate 50 hours were tracked under <<LAST_PROJECT>> and there was another 6 hrs 57 min under Lumen, so a total of around 57 hrs.)
