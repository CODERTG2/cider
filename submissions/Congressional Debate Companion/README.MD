Name: Congressional Debate Companion

Description: This year, I began competing in Congressional Debate. I absoluetly loved it, but there were no tools online that provided features that a Congressional Debate competitior would love. For this reason, I build Congressional Debate Companion, which has a plethora of features for those wanting to compete in Congressional Debate.
