**Name**: Elara: The ultimate time tracker, where time meets tranquility

**Description**: Elara is an app I built because I used to use a service called Flocus but I wanted their paid features but thought "hey I could make this myself and tailor it to be better!" and I made this.

**GitHub URL**: https://github.com/advaitconty/elara

**How did you build this**: I used mainly SwiftUI + SwiftData to build the app. It's a combination of stuff I've learnt and managed to put together to be as polished as I could make it. Took so long because I didn't like the original timer implementation, and then completely re-wrote it for the v2 edition of this app.

**Did you use Hakatime to log your progress?**: Yes. Originally, this app was called Solstice (can be seen in the macOS binary name) but changed it after I got my first account from Verdi for publishing because of copyright. Total hours: 46 hours, 51 min

**Testflight link**: I never published it on TestFlight, published it directly on the App Store, link is [here](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/elara/id6745421296). Newest version for macOS is pending App Store Review, the iPadOS app is pending approval for the usage of FamilyControls API

**How many users on testflight?**: None on TestFlight, 11 users from the App Store
