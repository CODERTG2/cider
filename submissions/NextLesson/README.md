**How did you build this**: I wanted to make an app, I took a Swift UI course on FrontendMasters and got to work. With some chatgpt help i managed to understand how most of the stuff worked. With the help of a friend i got a pretty stable and nice API up and running to provide me with the data I need as easy as possible. So after many many hours the app is now mostly flawless.

**How many hours did you spend on this**: I'd say about 24 hours excluding the course. Logged 17 hours of it on hackatime before i switched to my new computer.

**Did you use #hack-hour to log your progress?**: I used hackatime during most of the time spent on the app.
