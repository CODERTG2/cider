Name: Multicards

Description: An app where flashcards break the laws of phyisics and go multi-dimensional. On each side, you can have different items (question, answer, meaning, etc) and then test yourself on different sides without making a completely separate card set of the same thing. Share your sets with the world or keep them in your library to use them offline. The debut app of PhyoID, a user management system.

How did you build this: I first had to figure out how to make a public database for the app using flask and sqlite, and also had to make a user management system with those and JWT. After that, I had to figure out how to make an api call from the app, store the user data in app so that it worked offline, Make set creation, editing and deletion, and finally the actual gameplay. 
How many hours did you spend on this: 63 hours

Did you use #arcade to log your progress?: For the first 50-60 hours
