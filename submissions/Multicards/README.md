How did you build this: I first had to figure out how to make a public database for the app using flask and sqlite, and also had to make a user management system with those and JWT. After that, I had to figure out how to make an api call from the app, store the user data in app so that it worked offline, Make set creation, editing and deletion, and finally the actual gameplay. 
How many hours did you spend on this: 23 hours

Did you use #arcade to log your progress?: For the first 50-60 hours
