# Name
NexTB

# Description
NexTB is a React Native app that provides real-time tracking for trams, buses, and trolleybuses in Bucharest. It uses live data from the official Societatea de Transport București (STB) API, the TPBI API, and GTFS datasets to display detailed information about each vehicle—such as its ID, license plate, passenger count, and estimated arrival time.
What makes NexTB unique is its practical, user-focused improvements. It goes beyond just showing when the next bus or tram will arrive—it also includes an image of the approaching vehicle and shows whether it has functional air conditioning (AC). 
This feature was added based on real user experience: during hot summer days, many Bucharest buses become unbearable due to broken AC units and poor ventilation. The app identifies these “No AC” vehicles based on first-hand data collected from past rides, helping users avoid them when possible.
## How it helps:
NexTB solves a real, everyday problem for commuters in Bucharest by making public transport more predictable and bearable. It helps you: 
- Know exactly when your tram, bus, or trolleybus will arrive
- See how crowded the vehicle is before it gets there
- Avoid vehicles without air conditioning on hot days
- Get a visual of the vehicle coming

In short, NexTB gives you more control, comfort, and clarity during your daily commute.

# How did you build this
I started building NexTB as a way to apply what I was learning while studying React Native. The first version was simple and focused on core functionality like showing live arrival times using the STB and TPBI APIs. I uploaded it to TestFlight early on to test it in real conditions and get feedback.
While working on other projects like HCB Mobile, I gained deeper experience with React Native and best practices for mobile development. This helped me come back to NexTB with fresh ideas and better code structure. I tested it daily during my own commute, which helped me quickly identify bugs and areas for improvement.

Over time, I optimized the app to make it faster, more reliable, and more helpful in real-world scenarios.

- [Usage of the app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vUpiq2NspcSXt97rJm0_1rPJaoW4Aadx/view) - a video that fully demonstrates how the app works. It also shows how you can add/remove vehicles from the faulty AC list. 
- [Real life demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaGDOe4yaI82zab11RXlez2XTjMFIUpN/view?usp=sharing) - here you can see that the bus is the same model as shown in the picture and that the license plate numbers match
