**Name**: TrackCount

**Description**: This app keeps track of thing with (currently) counters and toggles. This can help in situations like keeping scores for your team games, visualize your to-do list and many more. It solved my problem for a need for something that can keep count, multiple at that, and in a way that was digital and easy to manage, and TrackCount does just that.

**How did you build this**: I used Swift UI to build the app. I started with my background knowledge for the base of the app, I then moved on making it editable and followed a few guides online and most notably learned with the resources from Apple's Developer website. In the long term the online guides did help me get far along the way.
