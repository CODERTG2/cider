# Droplet Socials

**Name**: Droplet Socials

**Description**: I built droplet as a way for me and my friends to share stuff in a fun way without having ads, promotions and data harvesting on the platorms we used. Droplet is designed to not be addicting, and to do its job with no unnecessary features. It's inspired by bereal in that there is only one prompt per day, chosen by a random member of a "bubble" (like a group chat), which the other members can reply to.

**How did you build this**: I used a similar tech stack to [My Runshaw](https://github.com/Dragon863/myrunshaw/), which is a FastAPI backend (but this time using sqlmodel and deployed on coolify), and I used flutter for the app itself. The hardest part was convincing my 2013 macbook to compile it without freezing up!

**Did you use wakatime to log your progress?**: Yes
