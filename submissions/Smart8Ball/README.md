Name: Smart8Ball

Description: Imagine the classic Magic 8 Ball, but instead of giving random answers, it uses AI to guide you through the decision-making process. Smart8Ball asks interactive, thought-provoking questions to help you reflect quickly and clearly. It’s designed to spark cognitive thinking by drawing on principles from psychology, human-computer interaction, and decision intelligence.
You can also get advice from your dream (custom) advisor and view visual summaries and decision paths as you go. Smart8Ball doesn't just help you choose — it helps you understand why you're choosing it.

How did you build this: I built this app using React Native with Expo. The UI was designed in Figma to ensure a clean and intuitive user experience. For AI functionality, I’m leveraging a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 model through Azure OpenAI. Supabase is handling the backend, including authentication and database management.
