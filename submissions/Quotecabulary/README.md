Name: Quotecabulary

Description: This app helps students study for the SAT by providing a daily vocabulary word, an archive of past words which can be filtered to only show the users favorites, as well as a space to save words that are found when studying. SAT vocabulary is best studied incrementally which is why this app would help students significantly.
Additionally, there is a quotes feature with motivational quotes by a chosen famous person and a place to store your favorite quotes, whether they be your own quotes or things that your friends/family said. It also includes a widget of the daily word so that the word is more visible to the user.
