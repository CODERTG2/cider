Name: StudyPlayProfit

Description: StudyPlayProfit is a game app aimed at making study more fun! Studying gets you tickets and diamonds which you can spend on games to earn more diamonds or to pull for boosts that will increase various aspects of the game! This project was made using React Native and Expo, which is a framework that allows for projects on iOS, Android, and the Web.

How did you build this: I used React Native. Started out by skimming Youtube videos online for HTML, JS, CSS, and React Native courses just to give me a general feel for the framework. Then I just dove right into the app, searching up things I didn't remember/understand/know and eventually with a lot of work I was able to make this!

Did you use wakatime to log your progress?: Yes
