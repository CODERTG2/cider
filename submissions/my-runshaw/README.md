**Name**: My Runshaw

**Description**: This is an app I made for me and my friends, although it could potentially be very useful for other students in my college (UK, equivalent of high school in the US). It lets us share timetables, get push notifications on bus arrivals, and all authentication and friend requests use the QR codes on our student ID badges. It's built with Flutter and python (backend only of course), and the backend API is dockerised. You can read about the creation process [on my website](https://danieldb.uk/posts/runshaw-app/)

**GitHub URL**: [https://github.com/cooldude/recipe](https://github.com/Dragon863/myrunshaw/)

**How did you build this**: I used Flutter to build this. I have some experience with flutter, but this was my first time trying to make a super maintainable app that can handle errors in a robust way. Again there is more on how I built this on my website (linked above)

**How many hours did you spend on this**: ~30 to 35 hours

**Did you use #hack-hour to log your progress?**: Ye (but I started before high seas)
