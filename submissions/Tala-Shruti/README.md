### **Description**: What is this app? How does it help you? What problem does it solve for you and your friends?

Tala Shruti is a clean and intuitive app designed for a sleek and easy way to get a digital shrutibox (carnatic pitch drone), with special optimization for Carnatic singers. It helps musicians and students by providing an easy-to-use solution for precise scales. This app addresses the problem of overly complicated shrutibox apps with their messy UI and not working components, making it a favorite among teachers and performers for its simplicity and effectiveness.
