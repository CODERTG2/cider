**Name**: Alias - A New Twist on The Word Game

**Description**: Alias Word Game - A New Twist is a fun and a brain-engaging game. In essence, The goal of the users is to describe words to people, the more you describe -- the better. Each person describes the words to their team members, and at then end the team that's first to reach the goal score wins. The users can add teams, change the game duration, the goal score, add penalties for wrong answers, and choose sets. The sets, or the word lists is what makes this app so unique and fun. A user can choose between various themes instead of being constricted by a single, boring list. That's why my app has various fun and educational sets: "Winter Holidays", "Gen Z", "Landmarks", "Emojis", and "Belarusian Nouns" (with more sets to come in the future). Additionally, in order to further promote curiosity and inspire users to learn new vocabulary, there is an option to look up a definition a word on Google. All in all, Alias can be used anywhere, from parties to roadtrips to school lunches, and in all of these situation Alias seeks to promote its goals of being engaging and educational, by exposing people to new vocabulary and actively engaging their minds, a skill much necessary in the growing age of technology and mass video consumption.
