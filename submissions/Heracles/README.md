**Name**: Heracles

**Description**: Heracles is a workout tracking app designed for weightlifters. One of my hobbies is going to the gym, and since I like to take a very scientific approach to it, I started using a lot of workout tracking apps. None of them met my requirements, so I decided to create my own.
