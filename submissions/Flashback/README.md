**Name**: Flashback

**Description**: Flashback is a social networking app that gives daily prompts to spark memories and inspire posts that can be shared with a close network of friends and family. I wanted to design a social media more personal than others, with greater privacy over who can see your posts. Additionally I wanted a way to share old memories with friends and remind myself and others of past memories that may have been forgotten in a shared journaling like way.
