# iOS App Submissions

**Name**: Lost and Found 

**Description**: This is a Lost and Found app built specifically for my high school. It's a mobile app where students can easily submit and browse lost or found items‚Äîlike water bottles, ID cards, notebooks, etc. It gives everyone a central place to report items they've lost or found, instead of relying on word of mouth, posters, or random announcements. It‚Äôs fast, easy, and works from your phone. Before this, when someone lost something at school, it was hard to track it down unless someone magically stumbled upon it and knew whose it was. Now, we can just open the app, check what's been found, or submit a quick report‚Äîand there's a better chance of reuniting with our stuff üôå

**How did you build this**: This is one of the first real projects I built entirely on my own after finally escaping tutorial hell. I started by learning the basics of React Native, then moved on to Firebase and Firestore for authentication and database needs, and styled everything using React Nativewind (a Tailwind-like utility library for React Native). I watched a lot of YouTube‚Äîespecially JavaScript Mastery‚Äîto grasp the fundamentals, and spent a ton of time reading documentation and building while learning. Instead of waiting to be ‚Äúready,‚Äù I just started experimenting and picking things up as I went. I‚Äôd never really built something end-to-end before, so this project became a personal milestone‚Äîproof that I could go from watching tutorials to actually building something real that solves a problem in my school community.
